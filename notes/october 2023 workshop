I wrote some software for myslef to visualize causal claims

This led to an article in political analysis where Adline Lo and I suggest that my systematic diograming can be a productive exercise
- one point of that article was that a lot biases creep in based on author
- prestige, race, discipline, institution prestige, citation couts
- focusing our relationships theorized and examined, can focus more on arguments and contributions than prestige

when invited to write this paper,
Show students how to use diagrams productively and responsibly
It's not there yet, but the aim is to show
Joe's insights about casing apply to how we are case or recase other scholarship---how we understand what their cases and claims are

Likewise, Erica and Nick ideas about translation do not just apply to translating our own research, but also any time we attempt to put research in conversation

the assumption is that diagrams can be helpful. In part, I am drawing on elicitation methods, where researches ask participant to draw diagrams in order to understand their worldview. I think we can apply the same logic to the commensurablity or incomensurablity



Lataur
- scientists are in the business of being convinced and convincing


Might be a systematic method

beyond communicating out own model

engament with literature - talk about it
- iterative
- fieldwork and framework

Better version of "how to do a literature review"

Connecting it to the theme of the volume
- why are our engagements

DAGs
theory and findings
- used in different ways
- applications

Process tracing - clarify * CAUSAL DESIGNS
- * BEYOND A RESEARCH TOOL

Concern
- variation on persuasiveness

Persuasive
- gaps - gap spotting

Less persuasive
- Meaning differences ("may")
- similar to ELICIDATION

I BELIVE THAT WE COULD RESON BACKWARDS
- it is when we run into trouble - SAME PROBLEM IN PROSE

EXPIERNCE - FEELING

make it about lit reviews?
Lit reviews
- BUT I AM WORKING JUST ONE TOOL FOR LIT REVIEWS
- ALSO, LIT REVIEW IS LIMITING - ITS FAMES RESERACH IN THIS LINEAR WAY
4 functions
understanding prior theory and research
identifying points of theoretical and empirical intervention
situating research in a scholarly community
- all of these things happen through the research process
also in translation and bounding after the fact

COMPLICATING CAUSAL DIOGRAMS
- dag to map out concepts? (this is sort of what the forestry example is)
- ven diagrams of concept compatibility (e.g., democracy)
- gertz on concepts


claims about causality
vs.
claims about cuasal claims

metadata on edges - what kind of changes

masking

Derek
- evidencary warrant ---> again metadata about edges




Is a DAG one way of telling a story?

Flattening

get from DAG to other direction


Joe - literature on racial capitalism
- interdependencies
- contradictions
- complicated literature - can be really useful

two arrows - concepts that depend on one another



LISA W on CONCEPTS
victinestine and pitkin vs goerts

Diana Sue Kim
- what is the relationship between description and generalizability?
- two dimensions = limits
- what does visualization do for generalizability?

Amel
concepts are creating the categories.

genalizing concepts (nodes) vs generalizing relationships (edges)

Joe and Edwardo + Jamila
- DAG drawing exercises
- useful beyond causation? - lit review frame ---> useful for mapping concepts
-

How do we build theory?
- one is a formal theory
- grounded theory - mythical thing
- - story in between
- in reality, we build theory on - theoretical work
